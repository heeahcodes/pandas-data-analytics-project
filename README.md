Objective : Evaluate whether tipping behavior differs between smokers and non-smokers, and whether this difference changes by time of day, after normalizing for bill size.

#### Why use a normalized figure?
Raw tip amounts are influenced by bill size. To ensure a fair comparison between groups, tips were normalized by total bill amount to compute tip percentage.

#### Visualization
A bar chart of average tip percentage by smoker & time has been included to facilitate easier comparision between the presented figures.

#### Interpretation
Smokers tipped on average 0.39 percentage points more than non-smokers. When segmented by time of day, smokers tipped slightly more during lunch but slightly less during dinner. The differences were small, suggesting smoking status alone is not a strong predictor of tipping behavior.
